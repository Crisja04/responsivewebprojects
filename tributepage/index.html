                <li>He read Natural Sciences at Magdalene College, Cambridge and in 2006 received a PhD in astrophysics from University College London, for his thesis on the early stages of star formation supervised by Ofer Lahav.</li>
                <li>As of 2017 Lintott is co-director of the Programme on Computational Cosmology and Citizen Science Project Lead in the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and a Research Fellow of New College, Oxford.</li>
                <li>He was the Director of Citizen Science Initiatives at the Adler Planetarium from 2010 until 2012.</li>

                <li>Lintott's research has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).</li>
                <li>In October 2006, Chris Lintott, Patrick Moore and Brian May co-authored a book entitled Bang! â€“ The Complete History of the Universe, which was produced by Canopus Books and published by Carlton Books on 23 October 2006.</li>

He was given this (quoting from the OII website): "in recognition of Galaxy Zoo's outstanding contributions to research by using crowd-sourced citizen science to capitalise on the availability of online big data-sets."</li>
                <li>In 2015, he won the Institute of Physics Kelvin Medal and Prize.</li>
